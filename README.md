# TestingProject

This project aims to create a very simple video game store which s accessed using a console interface. The program reads in data about a selection of video games from a local CSV file, which are converted into Game objects.

The user is able to select from a series of commands, including: viewing the store's stock, adding to and removing from a basket, and purchasing the basket.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate clean coding techniques, along with examples of doubling tests.
